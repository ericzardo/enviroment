# Overview

This repository is a collection of instructions and settings I use to optimize my development environment and enhance my experience on a daily Linux machine. 

The goal is to have all steps and configurations documented for easy reference whenever I (or anyone else) need to replicate or tweak the setup.


## Quick Note

These instructions reflect the **settings and tools that I prefer for my personal setup**. Feel free to modify anything to better suit your own preferences or requirements.
